<p class="text-faded">Kote lakay’m? maps the dyasporic locations of writers from Haiti during the Duvalier Regime (1957-1981). Haitian writer and literary critic, Yanick Lahens, describes the writers under Duvalieriste Haiti as the “lost generation”. Lahens’s “lost generation” focuses on writers in exile who faced censorship during the father-son dictatorship. “Kote lakay’m? ” offers a visualization of these writers' locations, highlighting how uprooted Caribbean subjects in dyasporic spaces echo Haitian epistemologies from their dyasporic communities that function as what Carole Boyce Davies describes as Caribbean spaces. My project questions, where did Haitian writers under the Duvalier era seek safety? What does this say about Caribbean space outside of the region? I offer a visual aid to Haitian studies that allows graduate students, scholars at all stages, and the general public to see Haitian writers in Caribbean spaces that challenge the binary arranged by François Duvalier and Jean Claude Duvalier. </p>
